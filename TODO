		[] Fix the Freemium Android Base App - 
			
			[] Monitize freemium versions ability  - Pollfish Support
				[] create the hooks to tell me if people are entering / completing polls
				[] have a config to enable pollfish or not
			
			Notes:
				[] Google Play Pollfish
					[] need special JAR
					
				[] Universal Pollfish
					[] need generic JAR
			
		
			[] It should have the marketplace, full verion etc in a proper config.xml file
				-- this file has the most recent updates as well
				
			[] It should correctly display updates based on if the version number is "missing all together" or "older" than
				the one in the current SQLite entry for the app, this way it will catch a new or updated install
								

			[] Finish Reading
				https://www.pollfish.com/#/android		
			
			So for everyone using eclipse, this is how it's done:

				Eclipse -> import -> existing android code -> browse -> navigate to google-play-services_lib FOLDER (android-sdk/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject).

				then, on your project, control click -> properties -> android -> libraries, add -> select the project you just imported -> ok


			Updates:
			
				Have the Settings removed from "strings.xml"
					pu them in settings.xml


			It should have the ability to:
			
				Turn on and off Pollfish
				Have a "featured" app (copy the tricorder app extra intent)
				
			BOTH apps are identical, but the "full" version just has no pollfish running
